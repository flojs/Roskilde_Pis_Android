Roskilde_Pis_Android
====================

This project is based on the proposal from the Roskilde Festival about investigating how to make people
use urinals with the use of a “fun factor”. The overall problem is that the air and soil during the
Festival becomes polluted from people urinating in bushes, fences and on the ground. If instead the urine
could be collected the Festival sees future opportunities in using the urine as a resource.

The focus of the project was to look into if online competition and social sharing could be used as the motivating “fun factor”.

Uploaded is the Android App for the proposed solution. A corresponding iOS app was created by Jonas Lysgaard-Hansen.  
The system furthermore consisted of a parse.com database and a facebook App.
